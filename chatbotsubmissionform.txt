1) Must identify a domain of expertise/focus: 
Our chatbots area of expertise is centered around the DHS Menâ€™s Soccer Program but can also function as a general chatbot.  


2) Must implement a database of at least 35 response phrases (use Arrays or Arraylists. You can also 
use flat files (csv)):


     a) at least 25 context based response phrases 


     b) at least 10 random responses


3) Must implement the word boundary algorithm from the Magpie project


4) Must define your algorithm, classes, and main methods used.


   a) Algorithm must have logic for at least:
               i) Responses for null input or input that would require a random or probing response.  


                   Required to have both random and probing responses 


  ii) Context setting responses (something your bot easily understands) 


 iii) Transposition responses that turn input into questions 


  iv) At least one unique response branch that you define and develop.


5) Must use good (Javadoc) format for comments [ make sure that each method is commented]


Extra Credit:


1) Use of Android Studio Speach to text  (you will be required to give a short talk on implementation)   


5% of assigned points  [ Note here that you have included this here, and see me if you have implemented this task]


2) Use of Neural Network or other Open Source AI libraries or interfaces (you will be required to give 


a short talk on implementation)  5% of assigned points.  [ Note here that you have included this here, and see me if you have implemented this task]


3) Log of all input/response and a plan  for using that log to  extend or refine the domain of knowledge for your chatbot. (you will be required to give a short talk on implementation) 5%   of assigned points.
